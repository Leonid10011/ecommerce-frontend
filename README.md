# E-Commerce Frontend in React with Material-UI
## New Frontend developed at [Mater Branch](https://github.com/Leonid10011/ecommerce-frontend/tree/master)
**[OLD Version]** I used this repository to make an first apporoach on developing an ecommerce project with React and MUI as frontend.The Code is poorly documented and also contains redundency, which is the reseaon I decided to rework it after I rework the backend. I used context API to handle the data, but I will exchange data handling with REDUX in the rework. MUI will be replaced with Tailwind.


Currently I'm reworking the backend completely while applying clean code and a documentation. 

**[NEXT UP]** After I finish the new backend, ([click here](https://github.com/Leonid10011/ecommerce-backend)), I will rewrite the frontend using REDUX and Tailwind styling. 

# Currently working on:
-[PAUSED] Currently Reworking the whole backend structure to REST norms. 

# Preview
The old backend is still running with this frontend [here](http://217.72.204.244/) . But there are some bugs and unfinished parts and I didnt used logging to trace down the bugs.

- [x] User management
